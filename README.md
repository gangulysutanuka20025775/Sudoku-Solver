The backtracking algorithm will have a start point, an intermediate checkpoint, a point not getting the feasible solution, and an end with the feasible solution.
•	Every piece of the board will start from the starting point and reach the intermediate checkpoint.
•	If the solution is not feasible, it will backtrack to the starting point. This process will continue until we get a feasible solution.
